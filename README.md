# jokes-app (can make you feel lightðŸ˜œ)

I've learnt **Lifecycle Methods** in React class-based components through this short-project. 

## About
* The color of votes and emojis changes based on upvotes & downvotes.
* The loading animation is shown until data(jokes) are fetched from [API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/).
* The user activity is saved on Local Storage.
* Each time the user clicked 'Fetch Jokes' Button, ten **new** jokes are displayed.
